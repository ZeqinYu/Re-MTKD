# Re-MTKD

## üì∞ News
* **[2025.10.22]** We have released the testing code.
* **[2025.10.18]** üî•üî• Our team won 1st place √ó2 in both the Detection and Localization tracks of the ICCV 2025 DeepID Challenge using our Re-MTKD framework.
We have released the competition Docker implementation at [ICCV-DeepID2025-Sunlight](https://github.com/ZeqinYu/ICCV-DeepID2025-Sunlight), which follows the same format used in the official challenge.
A testing-friendly code version will be released soon on this main repository.
