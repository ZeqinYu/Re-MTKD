# Re-MTKD

## üì∞ News
* **[2025.10.22]** We have released the testing code. For any questions, please feel free to contact us.
* **[2025.10.18]** üî•üî• Our team won 1st place √ó2 in both the Detection and Localization tracks of the ICCV 2025 DeepID Challenge using our Re-MTKD framework.
We have released the competition Docker implementation at [ICCV-DeepID2025-Sunlight](https://github.com/ZeqinYu/ICCV-DeepID2025-Sunlight), which follows the same format used in the official challenge.
A testing-friendly code version will be released soon on this main repository.

## üéØ Test
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ZeqinYu/Re-MTKD.git
    cd Re-MTKD
    ```
2. Prepare Model:
   The pretrained weights can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WOZdJY3VJ5SWpqPYTttGA36dRcU1OGSf) or [Baidu Pan]( https://pan.baidu.com/s/1GhCtZWbWld9Zx7GGpJxcVQ) (42rp), and place the weights into `/yourpath/Re-MTKD/Cue_Net/checkpoint`. Then modify the `model_path` variable in `/yourpath/Re-MTKD/test.py` to test different models.

3. Test Model:
   You can test Re-MTKD by:
   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```
**Note: AAAI 2025 Re-MTKD uses "resize = True" for testing; ICCV DeepID 2025 competition uses "resize = False" for testing.**
